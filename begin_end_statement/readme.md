# Ruby Begin and End Blocks

**Syntax:**
```rb
BEGIN {
    # gets executed at the beginning
}

# program body

END {
    # this block will be executed at last.
}
```

- Each ruby source file runs code section of Begin before beginning.
- In a similar manner, runs code section of end in the ending.
- Runs program body intermediately after begin and before end.
